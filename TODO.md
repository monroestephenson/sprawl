Identified Issues
Concurrency Limitations: The "Server is too busy" error consistently occurred, seemingly related to the semaphore mechanism limiting concurrent requests. This was encountered regardless of the approach used.
Publish Mechanism Issues: Attempts to publish messages via both direct HTTP and CLI tools failed with either "Server is too busy" or "unexpected status" errors.
Port Conflicts: Initial setup encountered issues with default ports being in use, requiring custom port configuration.
Documentation Gaps: Some discrepancies between command syntax in documentation and actual implementation were observed, particularly with message publishing flags.
Positive Aspects
Cluster Formation: Multiple nodes successfully connected and formed a cluster with proper node discovery.
Health Monitoring: Health check endpoints provided useful information about node and system status.
AI Capabilities: The AI prediction system worked well and provided sensible predictions for system resources.
Storage Framework: The tiered storage system appeared well-designed, though we couldn't fully test it due to messaging issues.
Recommendations
Concurrency Management: The semaphore mechanism needs tuning - it appears to be rejecting most requests with "Server is too busy" errors even in a light-load testing scenario.
Publishing Workflow: The message publishing pathway requires troubleshooting to identify why both HTTP and CLI-based publishing consistently fail.
Documentation Improvements: Command syntax in documentation should be updated to match the actual implementation.
Error Handling: More descriptive error messages would help diagnose issues encountered during publishing.

The changes look comprehensive and address the major issues identified in the feedback. However, I notice a few areas that could use additional attention:
Testing Coverage:
While there are some tests, we should add more comprehensive tests for the new features
Need to add load testing for the improved concurrency handling
Should add tests for the auto port assignment feature
Monitoring and Observability:
Consider adding more detailed metrics for the new features
Add tracing for better debugging
Implement structured logging
Documentation:
Add more examples for the new features
Include performance tuning guidelines
Add troubleshooting guides for common issues

# Sprawl Implementation TODO List

This document catalogs all placeholder implementations and unfinished features that need to be properly implemented for a production-ready system.

## System Metrics Collection

- [x] **Replace simulated CPU metrics with real host metrics**
  - File: `ai/engine.go:233`
  - Comment: `// In a real implementation, we would use the host's CPU metrics`
  - Description: 
    - Implement real CPU usage monitoring using the `github.com/shirou/gopsutil/cpu` package
    - Add a function to collect per-core and overall CPU utilization percentages (user, system, idle)
    - Modify `getCPUUsagePercent()` to call this new function
    - Store historical CPU usage data with timestamps for trend analysis
    - Add appropriate error handling for cases where CPU metrics can't be obtained
    - Sample implementation:
      ```go
      import "github.com/shirou/gopsutil/v3/cpu"
      
      func getCPUUsagePercent() float64 {
          percent, err := cpu.Percent(time.Second, false) // false = overall CPU percentage
          if err != nil {
              log.Printf("Error getting CPU usage: %v", err)
              return 0.0
          }
          if len(percent) == 0 {
              return 0.0
          }
          return percent[0] // Return the overall CPU usage percentage
      }
      ```

- [x] **Implement real memory usage tracking**
  - File: `ai/engine.go:219`
  - Comment: `// This is a simple implementation; a production version would use the host's CPU metrics`
  - Description: 
    - Use the `github.com/shirou/gopsutil/mem` package to collect actual system memory metrics
    - Track both virtual and physical memory usage
    - Implement memory metrics collection with the following details:
      - Total memory available
      - Used memory (total - free - buffers/cache)
      - Memory usage percentage
      - Swap space usage
    - Store historical memory usage data for trend analysis
    - Sample implementation:
      ```go
      import "github.com/shirou/gopsutil/v3/mem"
      
      func getMemoryUsagePercent() float64 {
          v, err := mem.VirtualMemory()
          if err != nil {
              log.Printf("Error getting memory usage: %v", err)
              return 0.0
          }
          return v.UsedPercent
      }
      ```

- [x] **Replace network activity estimation**
  - File: `ai/intelligence.go:233`

      - Packets sent/received per second
      - Network errors and dropped packets
      - Connection count and states (TCP/UDP)
    - Collect per-interface and aggregate network statistics
    - Calculate rates by sampling at regular intervals and computing deltas
    - Store historical network usage data for trend analysis
    - Add configuration to specify which network interfaces to monitor
    - Sample implementation:
      ```go
      import (
          "github.com/shirou/gopsutil/v3/net"
          "time"
      )
      
      var lastNetStats map[string]net.IOCountersStat
      var lastNetStatsTime time.Time
      
      func getNetworkActivity() float64 {
          netStats, err := net.IOCounters(false) // false = all interfaces combined
          if err != nil {
              log.Printf("Error getting network stats: %v", err)
              return 0.0
          }
          
          now := time.Now()
          if lastNetStats == nil {
              // First run, store values and return 0
              lastNetStats = make(map[string]net.IOCountersStat)
              for _, stat := range netStats {
                  lastNetStats[stat.Name] = stat
              }
              lastNetStatsTime = now
              return 0.0
          }
          
          timeDiff := now.Sub(lastNetStatsTime).Seconds()
          if timeDiff < 0.1 {
              return 0.0 // Avoid division by zero or very small time differences
          }
          
          var totalBytesPerSec float64
          for _, stat := range netStats {
              if lastStat, ok := lastNetStats[stat.Name]; ok {
                  bytesIn := float64(stat.BytesRecv - lastStat.BytesRecv) / timeDiff
                  bytesOut := float64(stat.BytesSent - lastStat.BytesSent) / timeDiff
                  totalBytesPerSec += bytesIn + bytesOut
              }
              lastNetStats[stat.Name] = stat
          }
          
          lastNetStatsTime = now
          return totalBytesPerSec
      }

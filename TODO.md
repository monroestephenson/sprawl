Identified Issues
Concurrency Limitations: The "Server is too busy" error consistently occurred, seemingly related to the semaphore mechanism limiting concurrent requests. This was encountered regardless of the approach used.
Publish Mechanism Issues: Attempts to publish messages via both direct HTTP and CLI tools failed with either "Server is too busy" or "unexpected status" errors.
Port Conflicts: Initial setup encountered issues with default ports being in use, requiring custom port configuration.
Documentation Gaps: Some discrepancies between command syntax in documentation and actual implementation were observed, particularly with message publishing flags.
Positive Aspects
Cluster Formation: Multiple nodes successfully connected and formed a cluster with proper node discovery.
Health Monitoring: Health check endpoints provided useful information about node and system status.
AI Capabilities: The AI prediction system worked well and provided sensible predictions for system resources.
Storage Framework: The tiered storage system appeared well-designed, though we couldn't fully test it due to messaging issues.
Recommendations
Concurrency Management: The semaphore mechanism needs tuning - it appears to be rejecting most requests with "Server is too busy" errors even in a light-load testing scenario.
Publishing Workflow: The message publishing pathway requires troubleshooting to identify why both HTTP and CLI-based publishing consistently fail.
Documentation Improvements: Command syntax in documentation should be updated to match the actual implementation.
Error Handling: More descriptive error messages would help diagnose issues encountered during publishing.

The changes look comprehensive and address the major issues identified in the feedback. However, I notice a few areas that could use additional attention:
Testing Coverage:
While there are some tests, we should add more comprehensive tests for the new features
Need to add load testing for the improved concurrency handling
Should add tests for the auto port assignment feature
Monitoring and Observability:
Consider adding more detailed metrics for the new features
Add tracing for better debugging
Implement structured logging
Documentation:
Add more examples for the new features
Include performance tuning guidelines
Add troubleshooting guides for common issues

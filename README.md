# Sprawl

A distributed, scalable pub/sub messaging system with intelligent routing and DHT-based topic distribution.

## Features

### Implemented
- âœ… Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for topic management
- âœ… Gossip protocol for node discovery and state synchronization
- âœ… HTTP-based pub/sub endpoints
- âœ… In-memory message store
- âœ… Efficient message routing with TTL and ACK mechanisms
- âœ… Basic metrics collection and monitoring
- âœ… Cross-node message forwarding
- âœ… Route caching system
- âœ… Basic load-based topic balancing
- âœ… Testing CLI tool for integration and load testing

### Coming Soon
- ðŸ”„ Tiered storage with RocksDB/LevelDB
- ðŸ”„ Message replication and distributed subscriber registry
- ðŸ”„ Advanced backpressure handling
- ðŸ”„ AI-powered traffic analysis and load prediction
- ðŸ”„ Security features (TLS, Authentication, E2E encryption)
- ðŸ”„ Cloud-native deployment support

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or higher

### Running a Node
```bash
# Start the first node
go run cmd/sprawl/main.go --port 8080

# Start additional nodes
go run cmd/sprawl/main.go --port 8081
go run cmd/sprawl/main.go --port 8082
```

### Using the CLI Tool
```bash
# Subscribe to a topic
go run cmd/cli/main.go sub <topic>

# Publish to a topic
go run cmd/cli/main.go pub <topic> <message>

# View metrics
go run cmd/cli/main.go metrics
```

## Architecture

Sprawl uses a distributed hash table (DHT) for topic management and message routing. Each node in the cluster participates in:
- Topic distribution and management
- Message routing and forwarding
- State synchronization via gossip protocol
- Load balancing and metrics collection

## Current Status

The core infrastructure is complete and operational, including node discovery, DHT-based topic management, and basic message routing. The system successfully handles distributed pub/sub operations with proper message acknowledgment and retry mechanisms.

Development is ongoing for advanced features like tiered storage, AI-powered optimizations, and production-ready security features.

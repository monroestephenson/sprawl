## 🧠 Core Engineering Best Practices

### 1. **Full Testing Suite**
- ✅ **Unit Tests:** Each component (broker, producer, consumer) tested independently.
- ✅ **Integration Tests:** End-to-end message flow tests with fake or real clusters.
- ✅ **Concurrency Tests:** Stress-test under high message volume + multiple producers/consumers.
- ✅ **Failure Mode Testing:** What happens when a broker dies mid-send? Does the system recover?
- ✅ **Benchmarking Tests:** Latency and throughput under different loads.
- ✅ Use `go test -race` to detect race conditions in concurrent code.

---

### 2. **Code Quality & Developer Tooling**
- ✅ Use **`golangci-lint`** + `go vet` + `staticcheck`.
- ✅ **Logging**: Use structured logs (e.g., `zerolog`, `zap`) with log levels (`info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`).
- ✅ **Profiling/Tracing**: Add `pprof` or OpenTelemetry to monitor performance.
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to run all tests + linters on PRs.
- ✅ **Pre-commit hooks** to enforce formatting and lint rules before every commit (you’re already on this — nice!).

---

### 3. **Performance & Concurrency**
- ✅ Use **Goroutines + Channels** wisely for pipelines.
- ✅ Manage memory with `sync.Pool` and avoid GC pressure.
- ✅ Benchmark with `go test -bench .` and document results.
- ✅ Rate-limit I/O and implement backpressure handling.

---

### 4. **Design Patterns for Message Brokers**
- ✅ Decouple Producer → Broker → Consumer (single responsibility, async queues).
- ✅ Use **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)** to disk (Kafka-style durability).
- ✅ Partition data for parallelism (per-topic or per-consumer-group).
- ✅ Implement leader election if you're going distributed (use Raft or Serf).

## 📦 Project Structure & Maintainability

### 5. **Clean Code Structure**
```
/cmd/your-app         # Entry point
/internal/broker      # Core logic for queueing, persisting, etc.
/internal/producer    # Producer client
/internal/consumer    # Consumer client
/pkg/                 # Reusable modules
/test/                # Integration test suites
/config/              # Config defaults/schemas
```

---

### 6. **Robust Configuration**
- ✅ Use `viper` or `envconfig` to read from ENV files or config.yaml
- ✅ Expose command-line flags using `cobra` if CLI needed

---

### 7. **Open Source Readiness**
- ✅ `README.md`: Mission, architecture diagram, usage instructions
- ✅ `CONTRIBUTING.md`: How to run, test, contribute
- ✅ `LICENSE`: Pick an OSI-approved license (MIT, Apache 2.0)
- ✅ `CHANGELOG.md`: Track version history
- ✅ GitHub templates for Issues and PRs

---

## 🔐 Reliability and Resilience

### 8. **Persistence + Recovery**
- ✅ Durable logs (Kafka-style segments)
- ✅ Indexes for fast replay
- ✅ Snapshotting for state recovery
- ✅ Safe shutdowns and restarts

### 9. **Error Handling**
- ✅ Every `go func()` should log panics or recover
- ✅ Retry queues / dead-letter topics for failed messages
- ✅ Graceful shutdown with `context.Context`

---

## 📡 Observability & Monitoring

### 10. **Telemetry**
- ✅ OpenTelemetry traces for producer → broker → consumer
- ✅ Prometheus metrics: throughput, latency, dropped messages
- ✅ Grafana dashboards for real-time insights

---

## 🛡️ Security (Optional for MVP, Essential Later)
- ✅ TLS for communication between brokers
- ✅ AuthN/AuthZ for producers/consumers
- ✅ Audit logs
